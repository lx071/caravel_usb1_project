User:
I am a hardware designer and I need you to implement a usb_transceiver to work on a usb host. The usb_transceiver mainly deal with the differential signals dp and dn, and it connects to both USB D+/D- port and USB full speeed PHY. The following code written in verilog is the input/output interfaces of the transceiver:

'''
module usb_transceiver
(
    // The side to USB D+/D-
     input            in_dp,
     input            in_dn,
     output reg       out_dp,
     output reg       out_dn,
     output           out_tx_oen,

    // The side to USB Full Speed PHY
     input           usb_phy_tx_dp_i,
     input           usb_phy_tx_dn_i,
     input           usb_phy_tx_oen_i,
     input           mode_i,
     output          usb_phy_rx_rcv_o,
     output          usb_phy_rx_dp_o,
     output          usb_phy_rx_dn_o
);

You knows the name of the I/O interfaces but you don't know what they means. Now I will tell you.

in_dp and in_dn are the signals receive from the USB D+/D- port. out_dp and out_dn are the signals transfer to the USB D+/D- port. The out_tx_oen is simply be assigned by the input usb_phy_tx_oen_i. 

usb_phy_tx_dp_i and usb_phy_tx_dn_i are the signals receive from the usb_fs_phy. usb_phy_rx_dp_o and usb_phy_rx_dn_o are the signals transfer to the usb_fs_phy. When in_dp == 1 and in_dn == 0 the usb_phy_rx_rcv_o will be assigned to 1, else assigned to 0.

The mode_i is the signal receive from the usb_fs_phy, and you need to take care of it.  Here's how to deal with it.
When mode_i is '0' the outputs are encoded as:
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 0 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 0 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Differential Logic '0'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 0 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 1 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Single Ended '0'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 1 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 0 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Differential Logic '1'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 1 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 1 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Single Ended '0'.

When phy_tx_mode_i is '1' the outputs are encoded as:
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 0 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 0 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Single Ended '0'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 0 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 1 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Differential Logic '0'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 1 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 0 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Differential Logic '1'.
usb_phy_tx_dp_i == 1 and usb_phy_tx_dn_i == 1 mean the output the USB D+/D- signals should be Illegal State. When in illegal state, both out_dp and out_dn should be 1.

When in differential logic '0', out_dp should be 0 and out_dn should be 1. When in differential logic '1', out_dp should be 1 and out_dn should be 0. When in Single Ended '0', both out_dp and out_dn should be 0.

Sure, I understand your requirements. Below is the verilog code.

module usb_transceiver
(
    input            in_dp,
    input            in_dn,
    output reg       out_dp,
    output reg       out_dn,
    output           out_tx_oen,

    input           usb_phy_tx_dp_i,
    input           usb_phy_tx_dn_i,
    input           usb_phy_tx_oen_i,
    input           mode_i,
    output          usb_phy_rx_rcv_o,
    output          usb_phy_rx_dp_o,
    output          usb_phy_rx_dn_o
);

// Assign output enable to the input from the USB PHY
assign out_tx_oen = usb_phy_tx_oen_i;

// Assign receive condition to the USB PHY 
assign usb_phy_rx_rcv_o = (in_dp == 1'b1 && in_dn == 1'b0) ? 1'b1 : 1'b0;

// The logic for different modes and input conditions
always @(mode_i or usb_phy_tx_dp_i or usb_phy_tx_dn_i) 
begin
    if (mode_i == 1'b0)
    begin
        case({usb_phy_tx_dp_i, usb_phy_tx_dn_i})
            2'b00: begin
                out_dp = 1'b0;
                out_dn = 1'b1;
            end
            2'b01: begin
                out_dp = 1'b0;
                out_dn = 1'b0;
            end
            2'b10: begin
                out_dp = 1'b1;
                out_dn = 1'b0;
            end
            2'b11: begin
                out_dp = 1'b0;
                out_dn = 1'b0;
            end
        endcase
    end 

    if (mode_i == 1'b1)
    begin
        case({usb_phy_tx_dp_i, usb_phy_tx_dn_i})
            2'b00: begin
                out_dp = 1'b0;
                out_dn = 1'b0;
            end
            2'b01: begin
                out_dp = 1'b0;
                out_dn = 1'b1;
            end
            2'b10: begin
                out_dp = 1'b1;
                out_dn = 1'b0;
            end
            2'b11: begin
                out_dp = 1'b1;
                out_dn = 1'b1;
            end
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule

 

This code uses the condition you explained to me to handle all possible situations that can occur. The mode and the input from the USB Full Speed PHY are used to determine the output signals.
